# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a compatability-based "FriendFinder" application. It is an application that takes in user input and compares their answers to the other data in our database. After the user fills out a survey and submits their answers, the application will display the name and picture of the person that the user is most compatabile with.

FriendFinder was created using Node.js and Express server & is deployed to Heroku. You can demo FriendFinder [here](https://brookemitchell-friendfinder.herokuapp.com/)
